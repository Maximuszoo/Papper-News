Título Original: Unified Crew Planning and Replanning Optimization in Multi-Line Metro Systems Considering Workforce Heterogeneity | Descripción: Abstract:Metro crew planning is a key component of smart city development as it directly impacts the operational efficiency and service reliability of public transportation. With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective multi-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for large-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on individual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination and rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework is presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with heterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model is proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally efficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous qualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation and shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed network model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both cost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by incorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during disruptions. This work highlights the role of global optimization and cross-line coordination in multi-line metro system operations, providing insights into the efficient and reliable functioning of public transportation in smart cities. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14251 ||| 2. Título Original: From Capabilities to Performance: Evaluating Key Functional Properties of LLM Architectures in Penetration Testing | Descripción: Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support, respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery, and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14289 ||| 3. Título Original: Detecting Pipeline Failures through Fine-Grained Analysis of Web Agents | Descripción: Abstract:Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic improvement. This work analyzes existing benchmarks and highlights the lack of fine-grained diagnostic tools. To address this gap, we propose a modular evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages for detailed error analysis. Using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web dataset as a case study, we show how this approach reveals actionable weaknesses missed by standard metrics - paving the way for more robust and generalizable web agents. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14382 ||| 4. Título Original: VCBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Venture Capital | Descripción: Abstract:Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and ARC-AGI demonstrate how shared datasets accelerate progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We introduce VCBench, the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital (VC), a domain where signals are sparse, outcomes are uncertain, and even top investors perform modestly. At inception, the market index achieves a precision of 1.9%. Y Combinator outperforms the index by a factor of 1.7x, while tier-1 firms are 2.9x better. VCBench provides 9,000 anonymized founder profiles, standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage, with adversarial tests showing more than 90% reduction in re-identification risk. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks. Designed as a public and evolving resource available at this http URL, VCBench establishes a community-driven standard for reproducible and privacy-preserving evaluation of AGI in early-stage venture forecasting. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14448 ||| 5. Título Original: From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) - A New Paradigm for Artificial General Intelligence | Descripción: Abstract:The debate around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains open due to two fundamentally different goals: replicating human-like performance versus replicating human-like cognitive processes. We argue that current performance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear, mechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to the development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True Intelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and lastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize results in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical, five-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable components a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with developmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building genuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5 AGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it and TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and given theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated, higher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and practically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures and latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based definition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research community. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14474 ||| 6. Título Original: Beyond the high score: Prosocial ability profiles of multi-agent populations | Descripción: Abstract:The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings, together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary, potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose future research directions to account for biases introduced by different testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex social settings. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14485 ||| 7. Título Original: DeKeyNLU: Enhancing Natural Language to SQL Generation through Task Decomposition and Keyword Extraction | Descripción: Abstract:Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance. However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500 meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14507 ||| 8. Título Original: Rationality Check! Benchmarking the Rationality of Large Language Models | Descripción: Abstract:Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents. Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior, both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e., practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14546 ||| 9. Título Original: (P)rior(D)yna(F)low: A Priori Dynamic Workflow Construction via Multi-Agent Collaboration | Descripción: Abstract:Recent studies have shown that carefully designed workflows coordinating large language models(LLMs) significantly enhance task-solving capabilities compared to using a single model. While an increasing number of works focus on autonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on historical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability. We argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction should also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To this end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow construction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the decision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of historical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task progress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent, allowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure for each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start initialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system efficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing workflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those required by existing methods. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14547 ||| 10. Título Original: SynBench: A Benchmark for Differentially Private Text Generation | Descripción: Abstract:Data-driven decision support in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance faces significant barriers to data sharing due to regulatory, institutional, and privacy concerns. While recent generative AI models, such as large language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks, their adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable behaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking. Existing anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for unstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the generation of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity metrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific complexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and specialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of varying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality domain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an unsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases. Third, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for synthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public datasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous privacy auditing and highlight persistent gaps between open-domain and specialist evaluations, informing responsible deployment of generative AI in privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings. | URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14594"
